Making the cookies
------------------

Please note that the size and thickness of your cookies will of course affect the baking time and quantity of cookies. The most important thing is not to let them get *brown*, only *golden brown*.

A variation is to make the 2-dozen-quantity recipe using unsalted butter and no vanilla. When mixed, press dough into a 9 x 9 pan and bake for 30 - 35 minutes at 325 degrees F. When cool, carefully cut into squares with a sharp knife. Dust with confectioner's sugar.

For chocolate chip cookies, use the bottom of a glass to press and flatten the cookies. Since they are thicker than rolled-out cookies, the cooking time is increased.

If you have a cookie press or cookie mold, then be sure to use it on the cookies!
